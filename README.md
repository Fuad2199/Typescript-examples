# Typescript examples
#### In this repository I learn TypeScript practically and also revise it.
## Why should we learn TypeScript?
## Why is Typescript important?
### 1.TypeScript is becoming the preferred language for modern web development due to its advantages over JavaScript:
### 2.Improved Code Quality: TypeScript adds type checking to JavaScript, which helps catch mistakes early and makes the code safer to use.
### 3.Better Scalability: TypeScript is used to manage and grow large projects. It makes it easier to maintain complex codebases over time.
### 4.Works Well with JavaScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means you can use both in the same project. You donâ€™t need to rewrite your existing JavaScript code to start using TypeScript.
### 6.Better Developer Tools: TypeScript works well with code editors and tools. It offers features like autocompletion, debugging, and type checking, which help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
### 7.Works With Popular Frameworks: TypeScript is commonly used with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, which improves type safety and the overall developer experience..
### 8.Catch Bugs Early: TypeScript helps find bugs at compile time (before the code runs). This saves time by catching errors early.
### 9.More Job Opportunities: As TypeScript becomes more popular, it opens more job opportunities, especially in companies working with large-scale web applications.
